The goal of this project was to determine if it is possible to visually detect the speed of a moving vehicle using vision through AI and street-facing security cameras. Computer vision technologies, including AI models like Yolo and Haar cascade, were tested for their ability to estimate vehicle speeds. The experiment involved setting up a robot and a laptop with an external webcam connected and then running trials to gather the cumulative accuracy of the AI model. My hypothesis suggested that this technology in security cameras would enhance neighborhood safety. While good accuracy was achieved with the basic haar cascade model, more performant models like YOLO faced limitations due to computational constraints, leading it to become infeasible. This project demonstrated that AI-based vision could estimate vehicle speeds with optimized algorithms.
